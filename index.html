            <strong> What is Meme Kombat?</strong>

            <p>
              Meme Kombat is a web3-based P2E game that lets you wager on
              battles with a focus on epic gameplay, trust, and transparency.
              Despite focusing on P2E, the project is also earning the title of
              being one of the top meme coins.s
            </p>

            <h2>Used tools</h2>

            <p>
              Meme Kombat’s total token supply is 120,000,000, of which thirty
              percent is allocated for staking and battle rewards, 10 percent
              for community rewards, and ten percent for decentralized exchange
              liquidity. Fifty percent of the total token supply is on sale in
              the ICO.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>- Slither: Solidity static analysis framework</li>
              <li>- Remix: IDE Developer Tool</li>
              <li>- CWE: Common Weakness Enumeration</li>
              <li>
                - SWC: Smart Contract Weakness Classification and Test Cases
              </li>
              <li>- DEX: Testnet Blockchains</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Meme Kombat</h2>
            <p>
              The platform features multiple ways users can wager bets, ranging
              from player-vs-player to sophisticated player-vs-computer modes
              that use traditional betting mechanics to provide realistic and
              fair betting outcomes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Initially, Meme Kombat will launch season 1, comprising 11 popular
              meme characters where users can bet on who they fancy to win in
              battles. Season 2 will follow shortly after with new characters
              and gameplay, and future development and game modes are also in
              the pipeline.
            </p>

            <p>
              Meme Kombat aims to provide an engaging and transparent way for
              users to bet and have fun. The platform is powered by the $MK
              token, with betting, staking, and other platform-related
              activities carried out using it. As such, providing there is a
              demand to use the platform, $MK will also fare in high demand.
            </p>

            <p>
              Besides its exciting betting feature, another draw to Meme Kombat
              is its lucrative staking mechanism, providing 118% APY. The
              generous staking rewards are a main reason for the project’s early
              presale success. Currently, Meme Kombat staking rewards
              significantly outperform the market average. For instance,
              Ethereum offers just 4% APY.
            </p>

            <p>
              Users must also stake tokens to bet on the platform. Consequently,
              much of the project’s circulating supply will likely be locked up
              in staking contracts, creating advantageous supply and demand
              dynamics.
            </p>

            <p>
              As mentioned, the presale has a $10 million hard cap. It has a
              total supply of 120 million tokens, and 50% will be available in
              the presale. A further 30% has been reserved for staking rewards,
              10% for exchange liquidity, and 10% for community rewards.
            </p>

            <strong>Roadmap for Meme Kombat</strong>
            <p>
              The roadmap for Meme Kombat outlines the strategic and
              chronological development of the project, providing insights into
              key milestones and future initiatives. The timeline reflects the
              project's dedication to continuous growth and community
              engagement.

                Outcome: This season will set the stage for continuous gameplay,
                attracting users, and fostering community engagement.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Potential Highs and Lows of Meme Kombat</h2>
            <p>
              One year ago, we ran an experiment and coined it ‘Play-to-Airdrop’
              (P2A). This was a brand-new concept. It allowed anyone with a
              wallet & an internet connection to participate. Users didn’t have
              to join alpha groups or get whitelist codes from influencers; they
              just had to play the game. Since then, the concept of P2A has
              taken over Web3. P2A campaigns have become the new standard.
